# Testing

PRKS uses layered tests. Contributors should run the cheapest test that proves a change while iterating, then use browser E2E for behaviors that truly require a real browser.

## Setup

Install runtime pins **and** development/test tooling before the fast suite. `python run_tests.py` preflights `openapi-core` (from `requirements-dev.txt`) even when Chromium/Playwright is not needed:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

A runtime-only install is enough to run the app, not enough to run the unit suite.

## Main runner

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

Runs the Python/API/structural/Node suite without Chromium.

```bash
python run_tests.py --e2e
```

Runs the full real-browser E2E gate against real PRKS server processes.

```bash
python run_tests.py --all
```

Runs the ordinary suite followed by E2E.

There is also an opt-in UX interaction tour:

```bash
python run_tests.py --ux-tour
```

## E2E iteration

The browser runner supports targeted/domain-oriented execution so development does not repeatedly pay the full-suite cost.

Useful modes include:

```bash
python tests/e2e/run.py --smoke
python tests/e2e/run.py --feature <group>
python tests/e2e/run.py --affected
python tests/e2e/run.py --last-failed
python tests/e2e/run.py --dev --feature <group>
```

The advertised full gate runs in parallel; debugging a single failure should normally use one worker.

`tests/e2e/policy.py` is the declarative source for feature groups, affected-file mapping, smoke cases, and related selection policy.

## E2E isolation

Tests use real PRKS server processes and isolated testing storage. Browser contexts isolate browser-local state. This is intentionally stronger than mocking the API because offline/service-worker/PDF/workspace behavior depends on real integration boundaries.

Performance optimizations must preserve those isolation guarantees.

## E2E performance

PRKS has explicit seed caching, sharding/timing history, profiling, diagnostics, and browser lifecycle controls. Do not "optimize" E2E by weakening assertions or turning real end-to-end contracts into mocks simply to reduce runtime.

See [docs/e2e-performance.md](https://github.com/Fooftilly/PRKS/blob/master/docs/e2e-performance.md).

## Static analysis and CI

Repository workflows include CodeQL and static-analysis checks. Local tooling also covers Python lint/type checks and frontend/static contracts through the project runners/configuration.

The dependency gate verifies dependency declarations/vendor state as part of repository hygiene.

## UX tour and screenshots

The UX interaction tour is separate from the normal E2E gate because it produces artifacts and has different goals.

README promotional screenshots use dedicated synthetic/public-domain demo tooling:

- `scripts/seed_demo_library.py`;
- `scripts/capture_demo_screenshots.py`.

Never use a real personal research library to generate documentation or UX-audit screenshots.
